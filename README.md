# Website Landing Page

A responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS as part of my early front-end development training.

## Project Overview

This project is a static website designed to practice layout, styling, and responsive design fundamentals. The goal was to take a design concept and turn it into a functional web page using only HTML and CSS.

This project was built as part of my progression through The Odin Project.
